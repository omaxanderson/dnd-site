<h1>DND Website</h1>

<p>This project is a dive into using the Laravel framework to build a more robust MVC style web application.</p>

<p>Currently the signin, campaign creation, posting, and very basic character creation is functional.</p>

<h5>Todo</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Create a better structure for adding users to the campaign</li>
  <li>Update the database to better support character creation</li>
  <li>Better character page to either view or edit a character and stats</li>
  <li>A current game session page that all the users can access at the same time that the DM will make changes to that will be pushed to the players' view</li>
</ul>
